BGPlay.js (+ real-time version!)
==========================
***News: This repo contains the classic BGPlay + the real-time version. It has received many performance improvements affecting both the versions.***

BGPlay.js provides a graphical and intuitive representation of the inter-domain routing and its evolution over time.

It has been developed as a part of the Masterâ€™s thesis of [Massimo Candela](http://massimocandela.com) at the 
[Computer Network Research Group](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~compunet/) of Roma Tre University (Italy) 
in collaboration with [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net).
